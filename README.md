# TestLibvlcNative
A test project I'm using to reproduce bugs in libvlc on win-x64 using docker

## How to build the project

Ensure you have docker and that you can bind-mount this folder into a volume (i.e. by default, you will need to put this folder under your user folder.)

open the docker quickstart terminal and run `./build-docker.sh`
